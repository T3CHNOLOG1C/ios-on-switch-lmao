/*
 * SwitchBootBand: the boot's background daemons yield the CPU to SpringBoard and backboardd until the home screen is up.
 *
 * From launchd to "Dismissing boot logo" all four cores are 86-100% busy (r7p5/r7p6 kprof), and daemons that nothing on
 * the home screen's path waits for (health, home, reminders, Siri knowledge, Spotlight, assets, analytics, widget
 * extensions, ...) took about a quarter of that CPU. The clutch scheduler gives their default and utility buckets a share
 * of every core even while SpringBoard's threads are runnable. While the band is open, those processes are spawned with
 * the CPU half of DARWIN_BG (switch_task_set_lowpri_cpu, task_policy.c): their threads run in the background bucket,
 * which still gets its share of an otherwise busy core; their disk, network and timers are untouched; an importance boost
 * (a message from a boosted client, e.g. SpringBoard's XPC) lifts it; and a turnstile push from a waiter still raises the
 * thread that owns what the waiter needs.
 *
 * The band closes for good at the first of: backboardd setting "System Boot Complete" on IOPMrootDomain (SpringBoard
 * finished startup, ~3 s after the boot logo is dismissed; IOPMrootDomain kPowerEventSystemBootCompleted) or 60 s of
 * uptime. Every process it held is put back then. One log line says when and how many. (The boot's full CPU and GPU
 * clocks are not tied to the band: they end at System Boot Complete itself, IOPMrootDomain's switch_perf_hint.)
