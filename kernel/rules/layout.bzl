"""Where the kernel's sources and generated files live, and how their paths are spelled in what the build ships.

The layout move (S3) took the kernel tree's drivers/, kits/, diagnostics/ and overlay/ from out/native-a57/root-v1/tree/
to the repository root (same relative layout) and its generated files from that package's build/ to kernel/build/.
Paths reach the artifacts (__FILE__ strings, debug info, the kernel's stabs): COMPAT_* keep the spellings the kernel
had before the move, so the move changes no shipped byte but the linker's object paths. Dropping the compatibility
spellings is a later, separate change (old_spelling and the compat maps become identities).

tools/kernel/common.py mirrors this table for the tools (keep the two in step).
