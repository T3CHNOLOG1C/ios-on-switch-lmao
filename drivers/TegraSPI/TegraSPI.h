// Tegra210 (T210/T210B01) SPI master for statically linked IOSwitch drivers. Only SPI4 (SBC4, 0x7000DA00) is described:
// it carries the console's 6-axis IMU (drivers/SwitchMotion), its only device.
//
// Hardware (Linux drivers/spi/spi-tegra114.c, "nvidia,tegra210-spi": intr_mask_reg, no DMA here; tegra210.dtsi
// spi@7000da00: GIC SPI 93, CAR clock and reset 68 = U bit 4, CLK_SOURCE_SBC4 0x1b4 with parents pll_p/clk_m;
// switchroot tegra210-nx-sensor.dtsi imu@0: CS 0, SPI mode 3, spi-max-frequency 8 MHz; tegra210b01-fric-pinmux.dtsi
// "IMU access": spi4_mosi_pc7/miso_pd0/sck_pc5/cs0_pc6, function spi4, MISO pulled up and input-enabled):
//   * tegra_spi_init() resets and clocks the controller from PLLP (408 MHz / 51 = 8 MHz, the 7.1 divider 100), muxes
//     the four pads, programs master mode 3 with the chip select under software control, and claims the controller's
//     interrupt (INTID 125), sleeping in ioswitch_interrupt_nub() until the GIC is up.
//   * A transfer is one PIO block of 8-bit unpacked words (at most the 64-word FIFO), full duplex, with the chip select
//     held low from before the first clock to after the last. The caller sleeps until the controller's RDY interrupt,
//     whose filter (primary interrupt context) clears it and wakes the caller, which drains the RX FIFO. There is no
//     polled mode: a wait that times out while TRANS_STATUS shows RDY panics with the controller and GIC state.
// Call from thread context only. Transfers on one bus are serialized by an IOLock.
